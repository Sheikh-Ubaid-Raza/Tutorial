Your task:
1. Initialize git repository in the project (if not already initialized)
2. Use GitHub MCP server to connect to the existing repository
3. Add all project files to git
4. Create initial commit with message "Initial commit: Physical AI textbook complete"
5. Push code to main branch
6. Trigger GitHub Actions deployment workflow (already configured in .github/workflows/deploy.yml)
